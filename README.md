# tootages- a simple gallery flask app for displaying images posted on a Mastodon instance's public timeline

Note: app.py and the template file need to be updated with 1) your instance URL and 2) your API key. 

Intended to be deployed on Heroku.

Proof of concept which uses the https://esq.social timeline: http://tootages.herokuapp.com.
